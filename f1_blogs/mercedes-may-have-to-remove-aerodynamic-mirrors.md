With new regulations for 2022, all teams are looking for the limits of the regulations to achieve the fastest possible car. In doing so, teams sometimes go a bit further and mainly look at what is not in the rules. For example, Mercedes' W13 now has mirrors on an aerodynamic part.

*_"The [FIA](https://www.gpblog.com/en/brands/fia) has said that the support of the mirror has only a structural function and only then an aerodynamic function. There is no reason to change that approach now, because in the past we also had to modify the car once for this reason,"_* Binotto said according to [Corriere.it](https://www.corriere.it/sport/formula-1/22_marzo_16/gp-bahrain-ferrari-binotto-vuole-vincere-non-firmo-il-secondo-posto-ce-giochiamo-red-bull-3e660dda-a4a4-11ec-93e2-dc8e38561d12.shtml).
